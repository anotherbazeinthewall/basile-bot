## Frontend

The frontend leverages xterm.js and Pyodide to create a development and user experience as close as possible to a Python CLI. Developers can focus entirely on writing Python code in `client.py`, while the JavaScript infrastructure seamlessly manages terminal interactions, browser integration, and the Python runtime. The template separates concerns, with reusable JavaScript components handling terminal display, environment setup, and communication, leaving `client.py` as the sole file requiring customization. It supports Python features like `print()`, `input()`, asyncio, and package imports via micropip, offering a native development feel. To start, simply copy the template, replace `client.py` with your own code, and run. With built-in support for error handling, network requests, and async programming, this lightweight, modular architecture makes it easy to create browser-based Python apps without worrying about JavaScript.

## Backend 

The backend leverages FastAPI to deliver a lightweight yet powerful RESTful API, supporting real-time AI interactions and external data integrations. It integrates AWS Bedrock for generating streaming AI responses, enabling dynamic conversations based on a structured prompt configuration. Modular services handle GitHub, LinkedIn, and resume processing: GitHub data is fetched and summarized into language usage and repository activity, while LinkedIn profile details are scraped from Google search results and formatted for clarity. A dedicated resume parser extracts and formats content from a hosted PDF, presenting it as readable markdown-style sections. Each component is designed with simplicity and modularity in mind, allowing easy customization and scalability. Together, the backend and frontend provide a cohesive platform for interactive, browser-based applications with minimal setup and maximum functionality.

## Deployment 

Deploying and managing this app is straightforward with `deploy.sh` and `destroy.sh`. The setup script handles everything from building and pushing a Docker image to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to configuring a serverless AWS Lambda function, complete with IAM roles and a CloudWatch warm-up rule. Local testing is a breeze with `docker-compose.yml`, and deployment outputs a ready-to-use Lambda Function URL. For cleanup, `destroy.sh` efficiently removes all associated resources, leaving no clutter behind. This simple, reliable workflow makes it easy to go from local development to cloud deployment without any fuss.
